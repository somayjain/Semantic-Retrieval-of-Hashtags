  <h2>Welcome to the Semantic Hashtag (and Microblog) Retrieval System!</h2>

The system has been built primarily using Whoosh, and Flask. (Go Open Source!)
</br>The problem that this system aims at solving is retrieval of hashtags relevant to a user query Q. The system also returns tweets most relevant to a user query. Go ahead, and give it a try! Need some inspiration? Here are some sample queries to try -

<ul>
       <li>Rock Concerts</li>
       <li>Dark Beers</li>
       <li>Red Wine</li>
       <li>Sports Leagues</li>
       <li>Fast Food</li>
       <li>Apple developer conference</li>
</ul>

<strong>NOTE: Some queries have no results, as the representation of those query keywords(or concepts) in our index is relatively small(or non-existant) due to dataset limitations. Hence, We're always in the process of adding more tweets to our index!</strong>
